## FAQs

### 1. What is Constant Copy & Work?
Constant Copy & Work is the store that the blog Constant Home & School is launching for proving faith-building copywork resources.

### 2. What is Constant Copy & Work’s goal?
Constant Copy & Work began as a way to share with you copywork resources that used fonts specially created for beginners and those who have learning difficulties. We want to simplify handwriting practice so the students can focus on the content.

### 3. What is Constant Copy & Work’s mission?
Our mission is to equip you with life-giving and faith-building copywork resources to help students grow in their knowledge of our God while learning to read and write, and beyond.

### 4. Are you a handwriting program?
No, Constant Copy & Work is not a handwriting program, but it is to be used alongside your writing program of choice.

### 5. What is your worldview?
Constant Copy & Work resources are protestant Christian in nature. You are more than welcome to use our resources according to your family’s needs, but be aware of that, please.

### 6. Can you sell me the fonts you use?
Sadly, the fonts were created under SIL Open Font License based on modifications made to facilitate reading. Therefore, we could not sell these fonts.

We hope that you can be blessed by the resources we are able to provide you.

### 7. I want to create handwriting worksheets for my students with specific text. Do you take orders for personalized content?
At the moment we have future projects lined up and cannot work with on-demand copywork orders. We will occasionally ask for suggestions on our social media, so make sure to follow us there to let us know your ideas!
