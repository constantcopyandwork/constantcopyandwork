In our family, we’re scientists by vocation. We felt called to homeschooling and went on to integrate the concepts learned into what we were doing at home. And if you are here reading more about copywork, you also **already know** how [**writing by hand helps you remember and understand things better**](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614524581)¹. Copywork reinforces instructions on the rules of the English language: penmanship, punctuation, capitalization, vocabulary, style, and in a general sense, grammar and spelling can be internalized through copywork.

Like any good scientist, I revel in piecing together data. And I have certain hypotheses on which types of letters and fonts can help **struggling students**. We want to simplify learning for all students, including those in the autism spectrum and those with learning disabilities such as dyslexia and dysgraphia. In line with our [**goal**](/contact/), I will address here the most common issues that show up in literature and our solution to those problems.

## Tracing and Dotted Fonts

Studies suggest that [**reduced global processing**](https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10803-016-2724-6) is present in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders². Handwriting difficulties have been documented in the literature³, particularly [**troubles with letter formation**](https://doi.org/10.1212%2FWNL.0b013e3181c0d48c). These students are already struggling with putting together the parts that make the whole. It seems counterproductive to make letter identification – and consequently, letter formation – harder by using glyphs made up of only dots, doesn’t it (read ahead for additional motor coordination challenges)? I have also had a very literal student who would only make lots of dots to cover the words. **To help, we use a lighter gray color to differentiate what the student is supposed to trace from the example in black.**

## Letter reversals

Both beginning readers-spellers and children with learning disabilities also struggle with letter reversals. Researchers have even [**linked reversals to our alphabet**](https://doi.org/10.1080%2F10888438.2013.873937): letters are more likely to face right than left⁴. Nonetheless, our principle of making things easier also applies here: **we made sure letters were not mirrored**. Five characteristics that [**improve readability**](https://doi.org/10.1145/2513383.2513447)⁵ and that we included in our fonts are **(1)** Sans Serif, **(2)** Roman fonts with **(3)** larger inter-letter spacing (tracking), **(4)** larger inter-word spacing that is proportional to inter-letter spacing, and **(5)** larger line spacing that is proportional to inter-word spacing.

## Word Spacing

Words that run over each other can have a myriad of causes: from being new to the art of writing to vision and motor problems. I would recommend you help the child isolate the words before writing them. If the student is still struggling, occupational therapists will often have the child estimate the distance between words by [**placing a finger on paper before starting a new word**](https://theinspiredtreehouse.com/handwriting-development-sizing-spacing-alignment-and-more/)⁶.

## Letter Formation and Beauty

Additionally, why don’t our worksheets have a dot marking where to begin writing the letters like other beginner worksheets? You will have to be involved in the learning process as a teacher. So while you are explaining to your beginning speller how you expect them to complete the worksheet, do make the dots if they still need them. Interact with their lesson; model the writing; use their favorite color! But if your students already know letter formation, then the absence of reminders will challenge them. **This way you can personalize your worksheet according to your needs.**

In fact, we recommend you start copywork by having your students learn and practice **letter-formation strokes** (check our [**freebie**](/blog/handwriting-tracing-guide/)!). That is especially important for students with certain disorders, such as [**autism**](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fbrain%2Fawn226) and [**dyspraxia**](https://doi.org/10.2147%2FNDT.S120514), that make learning new motor tasks more taxing⁷,⁸. After the strokes have been internalized, the student can learn to connect them into letters.

More than the mere practice of strokes, Charlotte Mason urges us to pursue “[**beauty of form**](https://www.amblesideonline.org/CM/vol1complete.html#237)”⁹, which is attractive to all students—and we agree with this urging. In our effort to create **simple, clean letters**, we strove to make them **look lovely** as well as to follow a **natural tracing flow**. That way, the **students can easily use the continuous stroke printing method with them**.

## Final Words

Will all the things mentioned above be **enough** for all students? I will go ahead and say it loudly: **probably not**! Only you can try and see what works best for you and yours.

For the best results, choose a good [**structured literacy**](https://iowareadingresearch.org/blog/structured-and-balanced-literacy)¹⁰ program to go along with our copywork. We all have to become a little bit like scientists when it comes to our children. Experiment, hypothesize, and test things out along the way…
