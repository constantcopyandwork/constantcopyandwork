If you are here, you probably want to make sure your children are growing in their reading skills.

We can help! How, do you ask? Well... Let us start with a little bit of what the **Science of Reading** says.

## Learning to Read

But, first, let me define the term “Science of Reading” or **SoR**. SoR is what is called the body of research on how we learn to read and what educational approaches work best.

**What we, as instructors, want is to transfer that knowledge into practices that will increase our students' chances of success.**

Cognitive research has proposed a simple way to understand our ability to read.

## The simple view of reading

**Fluent, efficient reading** involves two skill domains: **word recognition** and **language comprehension**. These two work together for you to be able to read — these and other — words.

## The reading rope

Those two skill domains are composed of a total of eight abilities required for understanding what you are reading: (1) phonological awareness, (2) decoding, (3) sight recognition, (4) background knowledge, (5) vocabulary, (6) language structures, (7) verbal reasoning, and (8) literacy knowledge. These eight “strands” compose the so-called [Scarborough’s reading rope](https://dyslexiaida.org/scarboroughs-reading-rope-a-groundbreaking-infographic/).

## When Charlotte Mason meets the Science of Reading

Enters **narration**, the first tool in our toolbox. When narrating, children are exercising **oral language-based skills**. They bypass the first three “strands” related to word recognition — particularly when narration is based on read-alouds. This helps them focus on creating **mental models** of the text.

## The building blocks of narration

The better someone is at building mental models, the more complete the narration. And the more they practice, the better they get at it. They can better **analyze** the text, interpret **connectives**, make **inferences**, and track **comprehension**. This, in turn, will improve their mental-modeling abilities, and therefore their narration.

## Visualizing the story

This is where you can help: ask pointed **questions** and model your reasoning by **“thinking aloud”**. That way you give your children practical tools they can use to improve their narration abilities.

## The best stories for read-aloud

The read-aloud texts themselves should be chosen from **varied sources** with **rich content**. A wise choice increases the listeners' general knowledge, and vocabulary. It also acquaints them with various literary forms.

## The second tool for developing readers

By aligning copywork — or transcription, for advanced readers — with the practice of high-frequency words we build up **word recognition** and **fluency** skills. And by including vocabulary exercises during copywork, you reinforce the whole process. There is no such thing as too much knowledge...

## Next steps

If you want to know how to get your narration off to a good start, keep an eye out next week for the **second post** in this **series**! We will cover which kind of questions and tactics you can use to make the most of it.

And if you need help with **copywork**, you should take a look at our [bundles](# "Shop"): we include high-frequency words flashcards to help with **reading fluency**, and vocabulary pages to encourage a habit of **dictionary** and **thesaurus** use.
